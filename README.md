__meteor__ is a work-in-progress, Gtk-based file manager for Linux.
It is of the two-pane kind, minimizes clutter and comfortable in a tiling wm.

Written in Python2, meteor aims for:
+ simplicity
+ configurability
+ good keyboard control
+ snappy experience

The program depends on [pyinotify](https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify).
